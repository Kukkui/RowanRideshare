Here are a list of existing bugs/issues:

1.The Schedule button on the home screen does not show the current schedule.
  -Ideally we show the schedule itself much like we show the address in Edit Address (with hint text).
  -Or we can show the schedule in another format with a brand new widget (not recommended).
